# 9image
![Docker Cloud Build Status](https://img.shields.io/docker/cloud/build/jecoz/9image)

This is a [plan9port](https://9fans.github.io/plan9port/) docker image, based on [debian-buster](https://hub.docker.com/_/debian). Useful for developers that want to create clusters of 9p servers that mount each other's files systems in their "namespace". We use it as base for [flexi](github.com/jecoz/flexi).
